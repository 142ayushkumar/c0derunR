# c0derunR

> Online Code Compliler / Interpreter.

An attempt at cleaner, minimal UI for coding, because no distractions. Made in
python. [Website](http://c0derunr.herokuapp.com).

Online platforms like HackerEarth, HackerRank, Codechef have their own IDE's,
but we aim for minimal disturbance.

* Supports debugging with appropriate messages, and you don't need to google
anything! Our results modal will do that for you ! ~~[WIP]~~

* Template code for each language. ~~[Works on localhost, WIP]~~

* While we were at it, we thought why not allow people to see their webpages as
they develop it. Clicking on `HTMLViewer` will blow your mind!

* ToDo : Suggestive text for an immersive experience.

## Usage

<pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;">sudo chmod a+x run.sh # only for the first time
sudo ./run.sh</pre>

You don't need to really install anything. `run.sh` takes care of everything. Really.
